# SFTP-Attack
A SFTP Brute Force Attack is a Python-based tool designed to perform dictionary attacks on SFTP servers. It systematically attempts various username and password combinations from a predefined list to capture valid login credentials.

# What is SFTP?
SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol), is a new and secure version of FTP(File Transfer Protocol). For transferring files between computers over a network we use SFTP. It provides a secure and encrypted connection, typically over SSH (Secure Shell), to protect data during transit. SFTP provide more security for file transfers compared to traditional FTP.

# What is dictionary attack?
A dictionary attack is a kind of hacking method in which an attacker uses a precompiled list of login credentials(username & passwords), called a “dictionary,” in an effort to repeatedly try and guess a large number of passwords in an attempt to obtain unauthorized access to a system or account. Typically, this list consists of dictionary terms, frequently used passwords, and password variants. Dictionary attacks depend on the possibility that the right password is among the entries in the selected dictionary, as opposed to brute force assaults, which attempt every conceivable combination.
